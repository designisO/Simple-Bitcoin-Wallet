## Bitcoin Wallet (Python)


### Installation:

pip install bitcoin

In this program, users are able to create their own bitcoin wallet address as well as public and private keys. Enjoy

### Advantages:

Functions have a simple interface, inputting and outputting in standard formats
No classes
Many functions can be taken out and used individually
Supports binary, hex and base58
Transaction deserialization format almost compatible with BitcoinJS
Electrum and BIP0032 support
Make and publish a transaction all in a single command line instruction
Includes non-bitcoin-specific conversion and JSON utilities


### Disadvantages:

Not a full node, has no idea what blocks are
Relies on centralized service (blockchain.info) for blockchain operations, although operations do have backups (eligius, blockr.io)
